# juce-alerts
This is an experiment including:
* bootstrap-like alerts widget: Click on screenshot.png.  (Based on these: http://getbootstrap.com/components/#alerts)
* GUI testing tools
* Areally handy FontAwesome class 

I started with the alerts, then after some heavy diversions also wrote some experimental GUI unit and integration tests and added a FontAwesome wrapper that I've been meaning to complete for months!

# Bootstrap Alerts
These simple overlays are great for 'mode-less' and modal loop free application design.  I'm going to be integrating them with some error handling classes I have on another project.  They are currently functional, but basic.  Really they were a great opportunity to test the FontAwesome class and the UiTestTools.h functions out.
