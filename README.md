# juce-alerts
Shows bootstrap-like alerts widget, GUI testing tools and a really handy FontAwesome class 

I started with the alerts, then after some heavy diversions also wrote some experimental GUI unit and integration tests and added a FontAwesome wrapper that I've been meaning to complete for months!
